## Prerequisites

* Enable SPI on the Raspberry P
* Python 3 or higher. The code and the ePaper library assumes you are
  using Python 3 or higher! (with Raspbian Buster, the latest is
  Python3.7)

**Install spidev, RPi.gpio, Pillow and requests**
**NOTE - Use sudo pip3!**

```
sudo apt-get install python3-spidev
sudo apt-get install rpi.gpio
sudo apt-get install python3-pil
sudo pip3 install requests
```


## Installing

This demo uses Waveshare's ePaper libary - see
[https://github.com/waveshare/e-Paper](https://github.com/waveshare/e-Paper)

but includes the necessary files from that library directly, so you
**don't need to install anything extra**!

```
git clone https://github.com/protostax/ProtoStax_ISS_Tracker.git
```

## Usage

```
cd ProtoStax_ISS_Tracker
```

**NOTE - Using Python 3 or higher!**

```
python3 iss.py
```

The program will run every 30 seconds, updating the
display with the current location of the ISS as well as the trajectory recorded
since the start.


## Running the script as a service

As an alternative, the Python script can be started during boot by creating a service - more info at https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/systemd.md

1. Edit isstracker.service - adjust the **WorkingDirectory** path
according to where you've installed it:

```
WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/ProtoStax_ISS_Tracker
```

2. Copy the isstracker.service file into /etc/systemd/system as root:

```
sudo cp isstracker.service /etc/systemd/system/
```

3. Start the service:
```
sudo systemctl start isstracker.service
```

4. Check if the service is running:

```
sudo systemctl status isstracker.service
```

The output should be similar to:
```

 isstracker.service - ISS Tracker
   Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/isstracker.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Tue 2020-06-30 07:00:00 BST; 24s ago
 Main PID: 585 (python3)
    Tasks: 1 (limit: 2200)
   Memory: 19.1M
   CGroup: /system.slice/isstracker.service
           └─585 /usr/bin/python3 iss.py

Jun 30 07:00:00 isstracker systemd[1]: Started ISS Tracker.

```

5. If the service is running fine, you can enable it and reboot the Raspberry Pi to load it automatically during boot:
```
sudo systemctl enable isstracker.service
```

6. To stop the service:
```
sudo systemctl stop isstracker.service
```
